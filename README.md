## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
