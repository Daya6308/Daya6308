## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.
